# Conference-Manager
This is an app I created for a tech trial. It is used by doctors and admins to attend or manage conferences. Admins can schedule, edit
and delete conferences, and invite doctors. They can also view topics that will be discussed at conferences. Doctors can add topics
and accept invites to conferences. The invites are added to their calendar.
